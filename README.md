# Vaccine Slot Checker
With the Government of India focussing so much on vaccination, they have made the CoWin platform so that we can search for slots for vaccination. However, there is one thing the platform lacked, just searching for slots smoothly without even the need to login to thhe platform, because in a way, that was completely unnecessary and it was absolutely hectic to login and then search for the slots. This Vaccine Slot Checker comes into play exactly to remove that issue and provide a hassle free process to check for the slots of vaccination.

## FAQs
### What does the application do?
The current version lets you search for the vaccination centers in your area by PINCODE or by entering your district. You can view the center's name, its address, minimum age and total number of available slots. The option to opt for a notification as soon as a slot becomes available is coming soon.

### What data does the app collect?
The app does not collect any user data so far. It only uses your internet connection to hit the required APIs and that's it. _I ain't that billion dollar company. :P_
